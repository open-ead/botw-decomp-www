This page explains how to keep up to date with the latest project changes.

## Repository

To update your copy of the repository to the latest revision, run the following command at the root of the repository:

```shell
git pull --rebase origin master
```

Occasionally (or if you're updating project tools) you'll also need to update the submodules:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Project tools

Update the repository, then run the following command to update project tools such as the match checker (`tools/check`) and the decomp.me uploader (`tools/decompme`):

```shell
tools/setup.py
```

In some cases you may need to update your Rust toolchain before you can rebuild tools. If you're using `rustup`, this can be done by running `rustup update`.

## IDA database or Ghidra project {#ida-database}

Newly added function names and type definitions can be imported into an existing IDA database or Ghidra project by updating the repository and then [following the instructions here](/contribute/decompiler-setup#import).

Note that there is currently no automated tooling to import only the types that have changed.
