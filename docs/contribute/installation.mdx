Follow these steps to set up the project.

## Set up dependencies

You'll need to install the following programming tools:

* Python 3.6 or newer with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)
* Ninja
* CMake 3.13+
    * If you are on Ubuntu 18.04, you must first [update CMake by using the official CMake APT repository](https://apt.kitware.com/).
* ccache (to speed up builds)
* xdelta3
* Clang (not for compiling BotW code, but for compiling Rust tools)

:::info
Ubuntu users can install those dependencies by running:

```shell
sudo apt install python3 ninja-build cmake ccache xdelta3 clang libssl-dev pkg-config
```
:::

Additionally, you'll also need:

* A Rust toolchain ([follow the instructions here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install))

* The following Python modules: `capstone colorama cxxfilt pyelftools ansiwrap watchdog python-Levenshtein toml` (install them with `pip install ...`)

## Dump the executable from a Switch

Next, you'll need to acquire the **original 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 `main` NSO executable**.

* To dump it from a Switch, follow [the instructions on the wiki](https://zeldamods.org/wiki/Help:Dumping_games#Dumping_binaries_.28executable_files.29).
* You do not need to dump the entire game (RomFS + ExeFS + DLC). Just dumping the 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 ExeFS is sufficient.
* The decompressed 1.5.0 NSO has the following SHA256 hash: `d9fa308d0ee7c0ab081c66d987523385e1afe06f66731bbfa32628438521c106`

## Set up the repo

1. Clone this repository. If you are using WSL, please clone the repo *inside* WSL, *not* on the Windows side (for performance reasons).

  ```shell
  git clone git@github.com:zeldaret/botw
  cd botw
  ```

2. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive`

3. Run `tools/setup.py [path to the dumped 'main' file]`
    * This will:
        * install a check tool (`tools/check`) to check for differences in decompiled code
        * convert the executable if necessary
        * set up [Clang 4.0.1](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html#4.0.1) by downloading it from the official LLVM website
        * create a build directory in `build/`
    * If something goes wrong, follow the instructions given to you by the script.

## Build

To start the build, just run

```shell
ninja -C build
```

Note that Ninja will perform a multithreaded build by default. There is no need to pass `-j` manually.

After the build completes, run the checker to make sure everything built correctly:

```shell
tools/check
```

:::success OK?
If you see an `OK` message, congrats! You have successfully set up the project.
