If figuring out how a modern game works sounds like fun to you, then you're in the right place! You're more than welcome to contribute; this is a group effort and every contribution helps.

If you have any questions about the project or if you need help with anything, come say hi on the [Zelda Decompilation Discord server](https://discord.zelda.deco.mp)!

## Prerequisites

To contribute to the project, you will need:

* The Switch version of *Breath of the Wild*, either 1.5.0 or 1.6.0 *(the Wii U version will not work)*
* A Windows, Linux or macOS computer
* At least 5GB of free disk space (for builds)
* A disassembler or a decompiler such as Hex-Rays or Ghidra
  * While not required, getting IDA Pro 7.6+ is highly recommended as this will allow you to use the project IDA database
* Basic knowledge about using Git
* Some basic knowledge about programming (ideally C++ or Rust, or a language with object-oriented aspects such as Python or Java). Familiarity with pointers.

What you don't need:

* :x: *Game dev experience*. Most of us aren't even game devs.
* :x: *Deep experience with C++.* Some of our contributors didn't know C++ at all when they joined :)
* :x: *Experience with reverse engineering optimised C++ code*. Very useful (for obvious reasons) but not necessary, especially if you already know how to decompile C code.

:::caution Windows users
Our project docs assume that you are using Linux (native or WSL) or macOS. If you are on Windows, we strongly recommend that you [set up WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to simplify the setup process. Ubuntu 20.04 is usually a good choice.
